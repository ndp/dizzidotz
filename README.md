There's this circle. A bar goes around it like a clock hand and hits "pegs" that are placed in it. It makes noise.

I saw a real one of these at the Exploritorium. Or at least I think I did. I remember it had twelve holes 
around in a circle, and you could place pegs in them. Then a bar went around and range a bell. 
So you could then make some music-like noise. This is kinda like one of those.
